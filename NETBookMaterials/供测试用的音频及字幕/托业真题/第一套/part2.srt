00:00:00,344 --> 00:00:01,267
PART 2

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:02,713
Directions:

3
00:00:03,335 --> 00:00:08,443
You will hear a question or statement and three responses spoken in English. 

4
00:00:09,027 --> 00:00:13,723
They will not be printed in your test book and will be spoken only one time.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:22,578
Select the best response to the question or statement and mark the letter (A), (B), or (C) on your answer sheet.

6
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:32,160
What time does the movie start tonight?

7
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:35,900
we're moving on Saturday.

8
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,070
At seven o'clock.

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,203
It was in the theater.

10
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:50,510
Where is the furniture department?

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,667
On the tenth floor.

12
00:00:55,563 --> 00:00:57,187
A sofa and two chairs.

13
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:00,086
I took it apart.

14
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:09,180
Who led the budget presentation yesterday?

15
00:01:11,076 --> 00:01:12,320
Yes, I read it.

16
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:15,815
The main conference room.

17
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:18,861
Ms. Varma did.

18
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,987
Would you rather drive to the game or take the train?

19
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:31,015
Let's drive

20
00:01:32,904 --> 00:01:34,676
On Thursday, I believe.

21
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:37,926
Please take it with you.

22
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,538
When are they announcing the winner of the competition?

23
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,818
At the radio station.

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,944
By the end of the week.

25
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:56,929
A gift certificate.

26
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:07,015
Would you like to make a donation to the arts council fund?

27
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,732
No thanks, I have some.

28
00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:14,055
He's very generous.

29
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:17,716
Sure, here's five dollars.

30
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,532
Who chose the restaurant for the company banquet?

31
00:02:29,384 --> 00:02:31,224
Maybe once last year.

32
00:02:33,144 --> 00:02:35,193
Someone from Human Resources.

33
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:38,480
Next Friday evening.

34
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:47,655
Are you going to accept the management position?

35
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:50,664
Everyone else.

36
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:53,926
They’re in finance.

37
00:02:55,784 --> 00:02:57,876
Yes, I start June first.

38
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:07,895
Which spaces are designated for visitor parking?

39
00:03:09,796 --> 00:03:11,440
Only for two hours.

40
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:15,513
It's alright, I'il take the bus.

41
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:19,280
The ones with yellow signs.

42
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:28,412
Wouldn't you rather meet in a conference room?

43
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:31,803
It usually doesn't.

44
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:35,249
A three o'clock meeting.

45
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:38,492
It would be quieter.

46
00:03:45,655 --> 00:03:48,129
Do you know who this jacket belongs to?

47
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:51,784
Yes, very expensive.

48
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:55,316
No, where did you find it?

49
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:58,738
It won't take too long.

50
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:08,092
Let's work through lunch to finish the project

51
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,618
A sandwich and an apple.

52
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,661
But I really need a break!

53
00:04:17,452 --> 00:04:18,836
It was this morning.

54
00:04:25,987 --> 00:04:28,886
Why does Dr Yang need another lab assistant?

55
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:32,566
I didn't know he requested one.

56
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:36,203
At least three years’ experience.

57
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:39,790
Yes, we visited the new lab.

58
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,942
Dr. Martinez will be free this afternoon.

59
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:52,313
I’ve been here before.

60
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:55,760
What about tomorrow morning?

61
00:04:57,661 --> 00:04:59,858
The pharmacy is just downstairs.

62
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:10,793
Can I write an article on the festival for Tuesday’s newspaper?

63
00:05:12,584 --> 00:05:13,907
You're right; it's too long.

64
00:05:15,852 --> 00:05:17,243
The deadline has passed.

65
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:20,418
He's at the museum now.

66
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:29,489
Don’t you want to see the apartment?

67
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,972
West of Main Street.

68
00:05:34,904 --> 00:05:36,504
We had to order a part.

69
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:39,956
I've found a place already.

70
00:05:47,335 --> 00:05:50,713
Should I order the supplies now, or wait until next week?

71
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:54,923
A total of seventy-five dollars.

72
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:59,175
Actually, I already sent the order.

73
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:02,590
It's in the supply closet.

74
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:11,507
How should I store these photographs?

75
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,458
Mateo is responsible for that.

76
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:18,947
From the company picnic.

77
00:06:20,806 --> 00:06:23,033
Yes, the staff is very helpful.

78
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:32,793
Where should I set up the equipment for the photo shoot?

79
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,670
That's scheduled for next week.

80
00:06:38,553 --> 00:06:40,547
It was taken in Amsterdam.

81
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:44,566
I got it from the electronics store.

82
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:54,049
You haven't seen Jennifer today, have you?

83
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,538
I saw her a while ago.

84
00:06:59,446 --> 00:07:00,824
I don't have any yet.

85
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:04,480
No, my name's Janet.

86
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:14,030
Could you help me find the Murphy Company file?

87
00:07:15,944 --> 00:07:17,126
I'm fine, thanks.

88
00:07:19,156 --> 00:07:20,400
He left a while ago.

89
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:23,649
I don't work on that account.

90
00:07:30,586 --> 00:07:32,782
Why has the workshop been canceled?

91
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,453
About twenty minutes ago.

92
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:39,840
In Room Fourteen.

93
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:43,831
Because many people couldn't attend.

94
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:52,897
You've already signed the contract, haven't you?

95
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,168
I'Il do it right now.

96
00:07:58,124 --> 00:07:59,893
Yes, I turned it off.

97
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:03,404
What does the sign say?

98
00:08:09,964 --> 00:08:12,773
I thought the professional development training was really helpful.

99
00:08:14,657 --> 00:08:16,115
I'd be happy to help.

100
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:20,097
That was my experience, too.

101
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:23,431
Sure, I'll take care of it.

102
00:08:30,488 --> 00:08:32,524
Where did you make the dinner reservation?

103
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:36,284
Tomorrow at twelve-thirty.

104
00:08:38,204 --> 00:08:39,493
Didn't you make it?

105
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:42,835
For fourteen people.
