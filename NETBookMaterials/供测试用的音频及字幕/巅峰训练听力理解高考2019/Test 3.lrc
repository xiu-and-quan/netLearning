[13:46.47]Attention, please. 
[13:48.25]Here are the new rules for drop-off and pick-up 
[13:52.37]during the school week. 
[13:54.35]As you all know, 
[13:55.71]school starts at 8:30 every morning. 
[13:59.38]We know that there is too much traffic 
[14:02.41]during the morning rush hour, 
[14:04.39]but we are asking everyone 
[14:06.46]to make more of an effort to arrive on time. 
[14:10.50]Cars will not be allowed to park 
[14:12.95]in front of the school after 8:35 a.m. 
[14:17.13]If you are running late 
[14:18.88]and need to drop off your children after this time, 
[14:22.53]we kindly ask 
[14:24.08]that you find a parking space 
[14:26.03]on the streets near the school 
[14:28.46]and walk with your children to the front gate. 
[14:31.41]School is over at 3:20 p.m. 
[14:35.11]and it often takes five to ten minutes 
[14:38.01]for the students to go outside. 
[14:40.28]Many drivers have been lining up outside the school 
[14:44.29]as early as 3:00 p.m., 
[14:47.04]blocking the road for half an hour or more. 
[14:50.36]The local police have told us that 
[14:52.96]this is a major safety concern, 
[14:55.70]and they will issue traffic tickets to anyone 
[14:59.18]parking in front of the school before 3:15 p.m. 
[15:03.90]If you have any questions about the new rules, 
[15:07.65]please see Anne Richards 
[15:10.30]in the administration building. 
[15:12.73]Thank you.
