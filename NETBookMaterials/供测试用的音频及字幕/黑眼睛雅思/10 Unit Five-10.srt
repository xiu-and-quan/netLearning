10. How to Select a Subject for a Research Paper (Part 2)

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:12,920
You are going to hear the second part of the talk on how to select a subject for a research paper .

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:23,266
Listen to the talk and write no more than three words for each answer . Now listen to the second part of the talk and answer the following questions.

4
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,960
I have just talked about the first step of selecting a subject.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,933
Now , let's move to the second step , that is to consider your parameters.

6
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:43,146
If you were asked to develop your own subject for a research paper , there are four factors you must consider :

7
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,040
1 . Time  .

8
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:56,600
The amount of time you have to write influences every writing situation ,  so you have to select a subject that you can complete in the time allotted.

9
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:03,110
It's crucial to allocate your time carefully from the day you get the assignment.

10
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,090
Before you plunge into the process , start by making a plan or timetable.

11
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,140
2.  Length

12
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,420
The length of the paper is also a factor in your choice of topics.

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,506
It obviously takes much longer to write a 50-page research paper than to write a 10-page research paper.

14
00:01:27,293 --> 00:01:30,920
Weigh this consideration as you select a subject.

15
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,820
3. Research.

16
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,200
The type of research you use also determines the subject you select.

17
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:58,426
For instance, if your assignment specifies that you must use primary sources such as letters and interviews , you might not wish to do a paper on Shakespeare , since relatively few primary sources are available and they are difficult to read .

18
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,026
4. Sources.

19
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:11,146
The number of sources you must use and their availability is also a factor in your choice of the subject.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,160
If you don't have an extensive library in your area , it might be harder for you to get the material you need.

21
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:28,600
I n this case , you might want to consider a subject that requires more primary sources such as experiments , interviews, etc.

22
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,280
Here are some guidelines to make the process easier.

23
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:36,360
Consider your purpose .

24
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:47,293
With the research paper , your purpose is to convince so keep your purpose in mind as you weigh the suitability of various subjects.

25
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:56,280
If you cannot slant the subject to be persuasive , it is not a good choice for a research paper.

26
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,990
Select a subject you like.

27
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,440
If you have a choice , try to select a subject that interests you  .

28
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:17,506
Since you will be working with the subject for weeks and even months, you will find writing your research paper much more enjoyable if you like the subject matter.

29
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,870
Be practical.

30
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:28,630
Writing a research paper is challenging enough without making the task that much harder for yourself.

31
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,700
Beware of "hot" subjects.

32
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:43,780
Some "hot" subjects often lack the expert attention that leads to reliable information , such research papers get stale very quickly; 

33
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,240
sometimes the issue can seem out-dated even before you finish writing the paper.

34
00:03:51,600 --> 00:04:01,150
The media, especially newspapers , magazines , radio ,TV shows , and websites , can be an excellent source of research paper subjects.

35
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,680
Consider your audience.

36
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:14,110
As you select the subject , always focus on your audience , the person or people who will be reading your paper.

37
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,906
Recognize that not all questions have answers.

38
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:28,626
When you write a research paper, you were attempting to find an answer to the question you have posed or the one given to you .

39
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:34,653
Remember that not all research questions lead to definitive answers.

40
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:43,170
Dealing with questions that don't have definitive answers can make your paper provocative and intriguing.

41
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,780
All right , any questions so far?
