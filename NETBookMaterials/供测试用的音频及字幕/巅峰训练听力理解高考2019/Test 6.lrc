[05:37.43]W: I think the position is pretty good. 
[05:40.24]And the neighborhood seems quiet. 
[05:42.87]However, considering the walls have to be painted again,

[05:54.54]M: I'm sorry, 
[05:56.34]but several people are interested in this flat,

[06:03.40]I'll show you another flat on Long Street this afternoon. 
[06:07.91]It's cheaper than this one.
[06:10.15]W: I'm afraid I have an appointment with my friend.

[07:50.36]I saw that you were working hard this morning.
[07:53.53]W: Yes, I got a lot done. 
[07:56.26]It's nice to be able to sit down

[08:03.05]Would you like to join me?
[08:04.82]W: No, thanks. I brought my own.
[08:07.21]M: If I woke up early to make my own food, 
[08:10.61]I'd be tired all day.
[08:12.88]W: Once you get into a routine, it's not so bad. 
[08:16.69]Do you work out?
[08:18.00]M: I usually go for a run four times a week, 
[08:21.76]sometimes less. What about you?
[08:24.74]W: I work out in the gym twice 
[08:27.18]during the workday 
[08:28.36]and I run on Saturday every week. 
[08:31.05]Do you drive to work?
[08:33.02]M: No. It's convenient to take the subway. 
[08:36.59]I could walk, but then I'd have to wake up early. 
[08:40.37]I dislike that.

[10:30.01]W: Well, I have to get my little Fred some medicine.
[10:35.23]M: Oh, is everything all right?
[10:37.41]W: It's not like he's sick or anything. 
[10:39.91]I give him medicine every month 
[10:42.45]as part of his regular care, 
[10:44.36]so he doesn't get any diseases from insects 
[10:47.85]or other dogs.
[10:49.19]M: Oh, right. I do that for Fargo, too.
[10:52.88]W: Yeah. That is what I'm going to ask you about. 
[10:56.25]Where do you buy your dog's medicine? 
[10:59.00]I wanted to buy from my vet, 
[11:01.20]but when she told me the prices, 
[11:03.47]I almost dropped dead right there!
[11:06.05]M: Yeah. Unfortunately, 
[11:08.46]most pet stores usually sell it at fixed prices. 
[11:12.44]But sometimes you can buy it 
[11:14.91]at a discount of ten percent in those stores.
[11:17.99]W: Well, that's not a huge help for something 
[11:21.03]that's two hundred dollars per year! 
[11:23.36]Isn't there any other way?
[11:25.75]M: Well, you can order the medicine 
[11:28.66]from some websites 
[11:30.13]that are based in other countries 
[11:32.25]where the prices are lower.
[11:37.93]W: Well, I have to get my little Fred some medicine.
