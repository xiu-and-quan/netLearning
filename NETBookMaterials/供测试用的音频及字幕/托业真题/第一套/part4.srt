00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:19,902
 l just realized that one of the food trays we ordered wasn't included

Good morning and thanks for inviting me to this board meeting.

92
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,533
You asked me to find ways for our company to become more environmentally friendly, 

93
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,568
so here's what I came up with.

94
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:40,053
 Here are four options for desktop management software.

95
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,733
 After business hours,

96
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,613
when most computers are not in use, these programs will automatically turn off our computers, saving costs and energy.

97
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:51,180
All are compatible with the hardware we use,

98
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:55,422
and the projected savings are comparable for all four software systems

99
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:59,564
However, only one has a system for backing up data in an emergency.

100
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:01,368
 So that's the one I recommend.

101
00:12:05,555 --> 00:12:08,204
Where does the talk most likely take place?
(A) At a press conference
(B) At a company meeting
(C) At a job-training session
(D) At a technology conference 

102
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:20,488
What does the company want to do?
(A) Hire a consultant
(B) Purchase new desktop computers
(C) Become more environmentally friendly
(D) Have employees work at night  

103
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,551
 Which option does the speaker recommend?
(A) $450 back-up system
(B) $350 no back-up system
(C)  $450 no back-up system
(D) $500 no back-up system

104
