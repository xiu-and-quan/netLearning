The whole delivery's in your warehouse now.

55
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:49,360
Would you be able to sign for them? I need a signature.

56
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,706
(Canada) M 
I'm sorry, this is my first day on the job.

57
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:55,306
I’d better check with the warehouse manager to see if I'm allowed to do that.

58
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,697
(Britain) W
Should I wait here while you check?

59
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,191

OK, Ms.

64
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:54,577
To have the whole exterior of your house painted,

65
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:57,964
including the fence, will cost you five thousand dollars.

66
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:00,613
(America) W
 That's quite a bit more than we expected.

67
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,173
 And actually Colgate Painting said they would do it for four thousand dollars…

68
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:12,275
(Australia) M
Well, 
 the cost of paint and supplies is included in the price I quoted you, so we really offer a very good deal.

69
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:18,782
(America) W
That's a bit of a relief.
If there are no other charges, we’ll probably be able to stay within our budget.

 I'd like to have them ready before the end of April.

75
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:20,906
(Britain) W
Sure.
 Should we take a look at the ones from last year or make them different?

76
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,280
(Australia) M
You know, 
I think the pamphlets last year had too many details.

77
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:28,124
 People can get dates and times from the Web site.

78
00:08:28,497 --> 00:08:33,093
(America) W
I agree.
 Lets focus on the skills that people will learn in each class.

79
00:08:33,377 --> 00:08:39,324
(Australia) M
OK.
I’ll come up with a rough version of the text for the pamphlet by tomorrow and e-mail it to you.

80
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:42,933

85
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:37,448
 I’m going to be out of town for the next two weeks.

86
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:41,671
(Britain) W
Certainly We can hold your mail here at the post office for you.

87
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:45,520
But you’ll need to put in your request at least a day before you leave.

88
00:09:45,822 --> 00:09:49,600
(Australia) M
That sounds great.
 Do I need to come into the office and complete a form?

89
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:54,391
(Britain) W
No, actually,

00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:51,128

95
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,875
(Australia) M
Ah - that's too bad.
Do you know which parts of the project you’d like to put off?

96
00:10:56,364 --> 00:11:03,208
(America) W
Well, I know we talked about adding a library wing on the west side of the building - but that’s very expensive.

97
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:07,475
 So, if we don't make that addition, that's all we may need to cut.

98
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,462
(Australia) M
You know, that’s not a bad idea. 

99
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:15,300
Let's see how much you'd save if I take the library out of the renovation proposal.

100
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:19,191

 A lot of people have been asking about it.

105
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,986
(Britain) W
Yes, well, I've been very busy.
But I am planning the training session for early next week

106
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:21,555
 That should make it quite clear to everyone.

107
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:24,426
(Canada) M
OK.
 But isn't there any written documentation?

108
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,751
(Britain) W
What do you mean?

109
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:28,551
(Canada) M
You know, a guide that staff can follow in the meantime.

110
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:30,693
(Britain) W
I don’t think that's necessary.

111
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:35,004
I'll have everyone go through the steps with me in the computer lab.

112
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:38,693

117
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:38,782
(Britain) W
Well, 
we carry all major brands of e-readers here - I'm sure we can find the right one for you.

118
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:39,884
(Australia) M
Oh, good.


119
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,853
(Britain) W
Are you looking for any special features?

120
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:47,102
(Australia) M
It has to be user-friendly - I'm not very good with technology.

121
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:51,235
I just want to read books - not watch movies or play games.

122
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:59,297
(Britain) W
In that case, I'd suggest this one It's very easy to download e-books onto it, and it holds up to three hundred books.

123
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:01,635

00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:55,848
I'm going to a conference at the end of this week, and Id like to take it with me.

129
00:14:56,284 --> 00:14:58,960
 Oh, and. Can you tell me how much it'll cost?

130
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,017
(Canada) M
Let me take a look… 
it's going to be twelve dollars.

131
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:03,546
(America) W
Oh, that much?

132
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:07,813
Your sign out front says dresses can be cleaned from seven dollars and up.

Well yes, but it's the material the dress is made of.

 We have to use special cleaning products to make sure we don't damage the fabric

135

Hi, Jim.
 I hear you're going to the jazz concert on Friday.

141
00:16:15,857 --> 00:16:17,253
 Can I ask you a favor?

Hmm.
 I'm not sure yet if Eduardo is joining us.
