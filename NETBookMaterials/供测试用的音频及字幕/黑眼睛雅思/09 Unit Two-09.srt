Welcome to the library tour.  You can see our library is a 4-storey building .

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,870
We'll begin our tour of the first level of library here at the entrance.

00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:34,890
We'll go in a clockwise direction . Here is a map of the library that may help you.

7
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,906
The room facing us is the Catalogue section .

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,700
As you can see ,it's a computerized catalogue system and it's very easy to use.

9
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,870
On our left is the Loans and Return section.

10
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,520
There is a Circulation desk for borrowing and returning books.

11
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,560
Next to the Loans and Return section , you will see the section for newspapers and magazines.

12
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:09,410
The library has an extensive collection of local and international English language newspapers and magazines.

13
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,420
They are kept on those shelves for one month and then stored elsewhere.

14
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,280
As we continue our tour , in the far left corner, you will see a large room.

15
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,173
That is our Reference section .

16
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,493
As we know , reference texts cannot be borrowed for use outside the library ;

17
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:40,140
they must be used within the library , so you will say some nice seating area for you to read the books in this section.

18
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,693
In the far right corner is the photocopy room.

19
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:52,840
There are ten copies for student use in the photocopy room and we've recently added two color copiers.

20
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,790
The system for copying uses cards, not coins.

21
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:04,240
You can buy a photocopy card from the technician in charge of the photocopying room.

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,610
The Audio-Visual Resource is between the Reference section and the photocopy room.

23
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,340
You can come in here if you wish to listen to a tape or watch one of the library's videos.

24
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,100
We have a large collection of movies in different languages here.

25
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,830
Next to the photocopy room, you will see the stairs to Level 2.

26
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,306
Beside the stairs are the restrooms for this floor .

27
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:37,040
To go up to the other levels of the library you have to use the lifts.

28
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:45,213
In the center of this level, behind the Catalog section ,you can see two conference rooms.

29
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:54,390
You can work on group projects in the conference room without disturbing anyone , so there's a conference room on each level of the library.

30
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,450
Next to the restrooms, we come to our Closed Reserve room.

31
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:08,400
As most of you probably know , it is a collection of books that are in high demand so they are on restricted circulation.

32
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:17,570
If a book is on Closed Reserves section ,you can only borrow it to use within the library for three hours at a time.

33
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,580
Next to our Closed Reserve room is a small study room for teachers only.

34
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:28,866
The lift is between the entrance and the student lockers .

35
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,760
Okay , that's the end of the tour of this level of the library.

36
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,826
I'll leave you to look around yourselves .

37
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:45,100
