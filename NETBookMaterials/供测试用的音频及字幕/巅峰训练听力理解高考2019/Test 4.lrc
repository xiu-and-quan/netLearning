[08:09.04]That's part of our set for our school play. 
[08:12.71]It's just for show. Did you hurt yourself?
[08:15.73]M: No, but look at my shirt.
[08:18.51]W: Oh, no. 
[08:19.52]I guess it touched a newly painted stain.

[08:26.48]M: My mom will kill me. 
[08:28.57]She just washed the grass stain out of it last night.

[10:28.32]M: My life is such a mess!
[10:31.89]W: What do you mean?
[10:33.41]M: If I hadn't accepted a job 
[10:36.14]as soon as I graduated, 
[10:37.90]I could have traveled around Europe all summer-
[10:41.56]just like you did.
[10:43.47]W: You know, I wish I hadn't gone to Europe, 
[10:47.08]but had taken the great job I was offered. 
[10:50.58]After I returned from Europe three weeks later, 
[10:53.85]it was too late.
[10:55.75]M: But my job makes me feel bad. 
[10:58.51]Four years ago, the moment I started it, 
[11:01.36]I disliked it. And nothing has changed.
[11:05.27]W: You can look for a new job. 
[11:07.14]I posted my application online last month 
[11:10.72]and five companies telephoned me right away. 
[11:14.46]And I accepted one of the job offers. 
[11:17.43]It is just the job I want to do.
[11:20.40]M: Really? Great! But for me right now, 
[11:24.48]the problem is that I get a very good salary, 
[11:28.28]and I've just bought a house. 
[11:30.54]If I hadn't bought the house, 
[11:32.68]I'd be able to take a low-paying job.
[11:35.59]W: If I had a better salary, 
[11:37.24]I'd buy a house, too.
[11:42.41]M: My life is such a mess!
[11:45.10]W: What do you mean?

[13:48.43]Today it's my great honor to be here. 
[13:51.53]You know, my Nigerian publisher 
[13:53.96]and I have just started a non-profit organization 
[13:57.80]called Farafina Trust. 
[14:00.08]Why did I choose to do this? 
[14:02.43]I grew up reading British 
[14:04.65]and American children's books in Nigeria. 
[14:07.85]When I began to write, 
[14:09.64]I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading: 
[14:14.04]All my characters were white and blue-eyed; 
[14:17.65]they ate apples and talked a lot about the weather, 
[14:21.35]despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. 
[14:24.55]We ate mangoes, 
[14:26.03]and we never talked about the weather. 
[14:28.59]Because as a child, 
[14:30.36]all I had read were books 
[14:32.85]in which characters were foreign, 
[14:34.93]I had become convinced that books 
[14:37.59]by their very nature 
[14:39.28]had to have foreigners in them. 
[14:41.72]Things changed when I discovered African books. 
[14:45.66]Because of two African writers, 
[14:48.31]Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye, 
[14:51.35]I went through a mental shift in my idea of literature. 
[14:55.88]I realized that people like me, 
[14:58.60]girls with skin the color of chocolate, 
[15:01.67]could also exist in literature. 
[15:04.55]I started to write about things I recognized. 
[15:08.08]So what the discovery of African writers did for me was this: 
[15:13.50]It saved me from having a single story of what books are.
[15:19.61]Today it's my great honor to be here.
