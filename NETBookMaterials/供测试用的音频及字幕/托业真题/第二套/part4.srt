One of the articles will be about free mobile applications that make vacationing easier and cheaper.

9
00:00:49,697 --> 00:00:55,733
So, your first research assignment is to look into the latest free apps that provide travel information

10
00:00:56,195 --> 00:00:59,866
things like local accommodations or public transportation.

11
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:03,902
Please send me the names of the apps you find by the end of the day.

12

26
00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:22,746
The clients have asked us to speed up construction.

27
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:29,502
The only way we can finish by April twelfth is by having half the crew work on Sundays.

28
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,022
Tell me if you’re available. You know the procedure…

GS Incorporated announced today that it has started to package its products in a more environmentally friendly way.

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,715
Now, they come in boxes made entirely of recycled materials.

00:05:06,204 --> 00:05:13,280
After a short commercial break, I’ll be interviewing a representative from GS Incorporated about what inspired these changes.

Have you been wanting to lower your sugar intake but just can’t resist that sweet snack at the local café?

58
00:07:41,688 --> 00:07:46,897
Today, I’ll teach you about an eating program that will stop your cravings permanently.

59
00:07:47,422 --> 00:07:51,164
I used this program to lower my sugar intake, and it worked!

60
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:59,075
In fact, this program could help you change any eating behavior in one month. That’s not a lot of time!

61
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:01,822
The first step is setting goals.

62
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:07,351

69
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:17,342
Students from the Robotics department at nearby Newport University will be at the museum on Saturday

00:09:17,582 --> 00:09:21,075

78
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:30,240
and we’d like to offer you the job.

79
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,004
Now, as I’d mentioned, you’ll have to relocate from Chicago to Vancouver.

80
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:40,008
I’m confident you’ll like living there. It’s a great city, with a lot to do and see.

81
00:10:40,497 --> 00:10:44,008
So congratulations, I’m looking forward to speaking with you again.

82
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:48,560
Oh, and please keep in mind that KR Investors Group won’t be open next week.

87
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:47,173
The company president has asked our department to focus on online advertising.

88
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,426
So, take a look at the chart I passed out.

89
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,537
It shows popular types of Web sites with advertising space for sale.

90
00:11:56,053 --> 00:11:59,200
Although social media sites get the most visits,

91
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:03,208
I think we should go with the type that attracts our target audience.

92
00:12:03,697 --> 00:12:07,555
Although these sites only have about 3,000 users per day,

93
00:12:07,848 --> 00:12:12,222
the people who visit those sites will likely be interested in our product

94
00:12:12,728 --> 00:12:16,586
So our next step is to plan the designs for those advertisements.

95
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:19,386
Let’s break into groups to discuss that.

96
00:12:23,573 --> 00:12:26,613

I’m standing outside your store— it’s seven-thirty, and it’s closed.

101
00:13:21,253 --> 00:13:27,680
I don’t see a sign on the door, but I’m looking at your Web site on my phone, and it says that you should be open tonight. 

102
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:29,333
I’m disappointed…

103
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,297
I’ve made a special trip to your restaurant this evening to try the new spicy chicken sandwich for dinner,

104
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:39,271
and I even have a ten percent off coupon that expires today.

105
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,160
Will you still accept it if I come back tomorrow?

106
00:13:42,746 --> 00:13:45,680
I have some time and I’d really like to use the coupon.

107
00:13:46,204 --> 00:13:48,524
Please let me know. This is John,

108
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:51,697
