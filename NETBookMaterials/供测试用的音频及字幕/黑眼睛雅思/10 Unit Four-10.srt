10 A  Story of Galileo.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,426
You are going to hear a story about Galileo .

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,120
Listen to the story and choose the correct letter A- C . Now listen to the story.

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,980
Good morning, everyone . Today I'd like to tell a story about Galileo.

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,813
Galileo was a famous Italian astronomer.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,280
He was born on February 15 , 1564.

7
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:36,306
He went to school at Vallombrosa , which is a place near Florence, Italy.

8
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:40,400
He tried to learn science there, but he did not like it.

9
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:44,773
He went to the University of Pisa to continue  his studies.

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,340
He became a professor of mathematics when he was at the age of 25.

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:57,586
His free expressions of opinion won him such unpopularity that he had to resign.

12
00:00:58,253 --> 00:01:05,640
In 1592 he went to Padua as a professor of mathematics, where he made a series of discoveries.

13
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,266
Most of the scientists believed Aristotle said that heavy things fall faster than light things.

14
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,986
This remained true until the time of Galileo.

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,613
Galileo did not believe it.

16
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,586
He made an experiment.

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,213
There is a famous tower at Pisa.

18
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,706
It does not stand straight up , but leans a little more each year .

19
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:32,560
Some scientists believe that it will soon fall down.

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,466
Galileo climbed to the top of the leaning tower , and from there he dropped two weights.

21
00:01:40,026 --> 00:01:44,960
One of them was heavier than the other, but they reached the ground at the same moment.

22
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,810
The scientists who were watching were very surprised -- this did not agree with Aristotle's rule.

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,253
 Galileo believed that scientists ought always to make  experiments .

24
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,160
He said that they ought not only to   sit in   university and talk ; they ought to do something .

25
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:10,693
They ought to watch  the result of their experiments , and   describe them honestly .

26
00:02:11,426 --> 00:02:14,106
Then they could learn more about science .

27
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,560
Many people of that time believed that the earth never moved .

28
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:26,893
The other planets and the sun appeared to move around the earth , and they believed that the earth was the center of the universe.

29
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,360
Ptolemy had taught this many years before , and it appeared to be true.

30
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,710
Nobody knew that the earth was an unimportant planet.

31
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,906
Copernicus was an astronomer and a scientist who had studied the planets and the stars .

32
00:02:44,506 --> 00:02:45,906
His ideas were new.

33
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:52,453
He said that the earth moved round the sun , and that it was not the center of everything.

34
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,680
He put these ideas into a book but he hid the book.

35
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,320
Nobody could read it until Copernicus died.

36
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,133
Many years later, Galileo read it and believed it.

37
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:10,680
He said that the earth was moving round the sun , and this made a lot of people angry .

38
00:03:11,213 --> 00:03:14,720
They believed that the earth was too important to move .

39
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,253
They said that it must be the center of the universe.

40
00:03:18,946 --> 00:03:25,320
Galileo got into trouble and he had to say that he was wrong, but he knew that he was right.

41
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,680
Galileo made many other experiments, but he also made some telescopes.

42
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,466
When he pointed a telescope at the moon, he saw some hills there.

43
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:43,386
He also saw some of the millions of stars in the universe -- more than anyone had ever seen.

44
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,573
In 1637 Galileo's eyes failed , and he could not see anything through his telescope.

45
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:59,410
Galileo return to Florence, where he spent his remaining years, becoming blind in 1637.

46
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,260
Five years later, he died . The world then lost a great man.
