[07:38.14]M: I've just received these hotel details from Johnson. 
[07:43.13]What do you think of them?
[07:44.81]W: Well, the most convenient place seems to be Stone Hotel, 
[07:49.26]only thirteen kilometers from the airport.
[07:52.28]M: But look how small the conference room is. 
[07:55.65]It can only hold forty people. 
[07:58.04]And there are only three conference rooms in the hotel. 
[08:02.86]I think the best is Sunset Hotel.
[08:06.09]W: Let me see. 
[08:07.20]It certainly has larger conference rooms than Stone Hotel. 
[08:11.77]Six conference rooms―that's OK. 
[08:14.79]The only bad thing is that the Sunset Hotel is the furthest. 
[08:19.35]It's forty kilometers from the airport. 
[08:22.53]Why don't you like this one, Guardian Hotel?
[08:25.44]M: I do, but it's just the price. 
[08:28.93]The equipment and service of the conference rooms 
[08:31.84]look great from the photos, 
[08:33.83]but it's definitely the most expensive one.
[08:40.27]M: I've just received these hotel details from Johnson.

[11:13.56]are a complete mess.

[11:17.15]Last week I stayed for an hour 
[11:19.86]after closing to clean everything up.
