[07:35.29]W: How was the lecture on modern economy?
[07:38.65]M: To be honest, I fell asleep during the lecture.
[07:42.82]W: Was it that boring?
[07:44.37]M: No. Though the teacher made me laugh out loud, 
[07:48.31]the problem is that 
[07:49.51]I couldn't stay awake for a two-hour lecture. 
[07:52.84]I've been working late in the evening in the hospital.
[07:56.37]W: Isn't that going to affect your grades?
[07:59.33]M: Probably, but I need to pay my school fees.
[08:03.13]W: Maybe you should talk to the financial aid office.
[08:07.16]M: But I'm trying to avoid getting into debt. 
[08:10.22]That's why I've been working so hard.
[08:13.15]W: Even though you have to work, 
[08:15.24]there's no need to work at night. 
[08:17.99]Well, I have a better idea. 
[08:20.86]Why don't you go to the student office 
[08:23.89]and see if they can help you find another job?
[08:27.71]M: That's a great idea. 
[08:29.88]I actually have a break before my next class. 
[08:33.34]So I'll go there now.

[10:28.96]M: Hi, Jane. Welcome back. 
[10:31.56]How was the West Coast?
[10:33.55]W: Terrific. I had a wonderful time.

[10:41.39]M: What did you think of Los Angeles?
[10:43.72]W: It was all right.

[10:49.74]The bus service was terrible 
[10:51.87]and the subway system was old, 
[10:54.34]so it was a little difficult to get around. 
[10:57.79]We had to rent a car.
[10:59.57]M: And was the weather good?

[11:05.37]and cool but comfortable in San Francisco.
[11:08.83]M: Cool in San Francisco? 
[11:11.43]That's surprising.

[11:18.71]Anyway, I loved it.
[11:20.64]M: So, which city do you like better?
[11:23.38]W: Oh, I like San Francisco better. 
[11:26.23]It's smaller than Los Angeles, 
[11:28.56]but it's a bit easier to get around. 
[11:31.50]And what is most attractive to me 
[11:33.94]is its beautiful scenery.
