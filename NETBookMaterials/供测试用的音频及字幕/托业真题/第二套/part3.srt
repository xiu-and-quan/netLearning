00:00:37,982 --> 00:00:42,631
(M-Cn) Ms. Chin, Ms. Frankel, I'm sorry that the gallery hasn't been looking very tidy lately. 

8
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:48,328
I've been so busy with all the artwork that we've been receiving that I have't had time to focus on cleaning.

9
00:00:48,773 --> 00:00:56,106
(W-Br) Oh, I know. The gallery's been so busy that it's hard to keep up with sweeping and dusting the main display area.

10
00:00:56,497 --> 00:00:58,471
(W-Am) Why don't we hire a cleaning service?

17
00:01:56,044 --> 00:02:01,164
Can you tell me which bus goes to the conference center at forty-first and Stockton Street?

18
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:05,822
 (M-Au) That's the number eight bus. The conference center is just two stops down.

19
00:02:06,062 --> 00:02:07,813
(W-Am) Oh good, thanks.

20
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:11,715
I'm a little concerned about arriving late for the opening ceremony.

21
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:14,480
(M-Au) Oh, it shouldn't take long at all to get there.

22
00:02:14,897 --> 00:02:19,297
And if you're going to be here for a few days, I suggest buying a weekly pass.

23
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:22,080

00:03:13,964 --> 00:03:17,120
(W-Am) I agree. My whole meal was excellent.

29
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:21,564
(W-Br) You know, this might be a good place to have George's retirement dinner.

30
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,217
(W-Am) Why don't we ask the server if we can make a reservation for a large group? Here he comes now.

31
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:29,760
(M-Au) Can I get you two anything else?

32
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:31,893
(W-Am) Actually, we have a question.

33
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:36,426
A colleague is retiring, and we're interested in having his dinner here.

34
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,057
Do you have space for an event like that?

35
00:03:39,244 --> 00:03:42,480
(M-Au) Of course! We have a large private dining room.

41
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:42,044
 I'm still on my way to the office, so I'm afraid I won't be able to go over our presentation materials with you.

42
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:44,568
(M-Au) Oh—The meeting starts soon.

43
00:04:44,906 --> 00:04:47,262
(W-Am) Well, the train I'm on has been delayed.

44
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:50,293
I'm sure you could lead the presentation without me.

45
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:53,333
(M-Au) Sure, I can do that if I have the handouts. 

46
00:04:53,822 --> 00:04:54,800
Where can I find them?

47
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,626
(W-Am) They're printed out, and I put them in a blue folder in my top desk drawer.

48
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,546

53
00:05:56,737 --> 00:05:59,662
(W-Br) Hi, I bought a shirt here for my son,

54
00:05:59,857 --> 00:06:02,275
but unfortunately, he doesn't like the color.

55
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,151
What's your return policy?

56
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:08,168
(M-Cn) As long as it hasn't been more than 30 days since you purchased the item,

57
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,448
and you have a receipt, you can receive a full refund.

58
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:14,995
(W-Br) Hmm, actually, I seem to have lost my receipt.

59
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:20,062
 (M-Cn) Well, then I can't give you a refund. But, you can exchange it for a different color.

(W-Am) Oh, it was great!

67
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,520
I saw a software application for corporate accounting that was really interesting.

68
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:24,702
Instead of using many different spreadsheets,

69
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:30,595
 this application integrates invoices, online payments, and expense tracking, all in one.

70
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:34,337
(M-Cn) Hmm, we'd really benefit from switching to a system like that.

71
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:41,102
(W-Am) I agree. I'm preparing a demonstration of the application to present at the management meeting on Wednesday.

72
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:44,222

(W-Br) I just heard about the company's plan to open a second housewares store.

77
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,613
They want to put it in the Centerville Mall,

78
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:40,631
but I don't think we'd get enough business selling household items there.

79
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:43,662
(M-Au) Well, the marketing team has done the research.

80
00:08:44,195 --> 00:08:49,902
(W-Br) I thought people mostly shopped for electronics at that mall, not decorative items for the home.

81
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:51,084
(M-Au) That's a good point.

82
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:56,328

(W-Am) Actually, I had my annual physical with Dr. Perez here last Thursday,

88
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:52,951
but I need to have him sign this form.

89
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:54,773
(M-Cn) That's right, I remember you.

90
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:56,604
What do you need the form for?

91
00:09:56,844 --> 00:10:01,920
(W-Am) Well, I'm starting a new job next month, and I need to give this form to my new employer.

92
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:05,226
(M-Cn) OK. Dr. Perez is currently with a patient.

93
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:10,035
I can give him the form to sign when he's finished. Would you like to have a seat while you wait?

94
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,622
(W-Am) Could I come back for it later? I need to pick up a friend from the airport.

95
00:10:14,622 --> 00:10:15,333

100
00:11:08,444 --> 00:11:11,173
But I don't want to spend more than fifteen euros.

101
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,288
(M-Cn) OK—we have lots of photo-enhancing software here you might like.

102
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:17,928
What exactly are you looking to do with it?

103
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,462
(W-Br) Hmm… well, most of the pictures I've taken aren't very clear.

104
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:27,955
I really want software that can sharpen the lines of each image so they're easier to see.

We usually start outdoor projects in the spring.

115

00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,457
Uh… when can I take it?

00:13:53,955 --> 00:14:00,773
(W-Am) We give the driver's license tests every week, but they're all booked until… July twelfth.

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,262
(M-Au) He sent me a picture of it this morning. It'll look great on our employee T-shirts.

135
00:15:23,582 --> 00:15:27,813
(W-Br) Speaking of the T-shirts… have we decided where to have them printed?

136
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:32,666
(M-Au) I've already called a few companies. Most won't print fewer than 50 shirts,

137
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,737
but there's one place that doesn't require so many to be ordered at once.

138
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:41,386
(W-Br) Great. Let's go with that one. We only need twenty to start out.

139
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:43,973
(M-Au) OK. I'll order them right away.

140
00:15:44,337 --> 00:15:48,506
That way we'll get them in time for our restaurant's grand opening on May fifth.

141

144
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,871
(M-Cn) Hi, Caroline. Did you see the chart that was posted in the break room?

145
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:48,977
I really like the nutritional program that Human Resources is promoting.

146
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:57,048
(W-Br) Me too. I think eating certain foods is important not just for our health; it also makes us more productive.

147
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:01,120
(M-Cn) I agree. For example, I've been told that I need more vitamin A,

148
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:04,257
and the chart shows me one fruit that is rich in vitamin A.

149
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:08,791
(W-Br) Of course, it would also help if the cafeteria offered healthier options…

150
00:17:09,182 --> 00:17:14,008
 (M-Cn) Isn't there a suggestion box at the cafeteria? Maybe we could submit some ideas.
