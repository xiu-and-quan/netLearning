Listen to the talk and choose the correct letter A- C . Now listen to the talk.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,750
Good morning, everyone . Today I'd like to talk about British newspapers.

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:28,253
Visitors to Britain are sometimes surprised to learn that newspapers there have such a large circulation.

6
00:00:28,973 --> 00:00:35,786
National papers circulate throughout the whole country and they can be delivered everywhere at the same time.

7
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,030
The circulation of national papers is more than eight million.

8
00:00:42,173 --> 00:00:48,040
There are two types of national papers , "quality papers" and "popular papers" .

9
00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:54,413
The "quality newspapers" are often held up  as an example of impartial journalism ,

10
00:00:55,266 --> 00:01:04,813
e.g.  The Daily Telegraph , The Times , The Guardian , <u>The Independent and Financial Times .</u>

11
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,013
The news often has a different angle to it.

12
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:19,373
Popular papers are often more sensational , e.g. The Sun , Daily Mail , Daily Mirror and Daily Express.

13
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:28,106
These newspapers usually impress newspapermen even more because they sell about four million copies every day .

14
00:01:28,826 --> 00:01:32,186
As we know , Englishman love to read newspapers.

15
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,730
You often see them reading newspapers on buses , in the tube and at bars.

16
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,590
They are thirsty for news.

17
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,450
British families generally buy a newspaper every morning and frequently two or three on Sundays.

18
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:56,280
Besides national newspapers, local newspapers sell almost as many copies .

19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,053
Local newspapers have a weekly circulation of 13 million.

20
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,000
Almost every town and country area has one.

21
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:20,946
These papers are written almost entirely for readers interested in local events : weddings , deaths , council meetings and sport , and the content is naturally influenced by the kind of community they serve.

22
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,340
Editors prefer to rely on a small staff who all know the district well.

23
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:37,660
A great deal of local news is regularly supplied by clubs and churches in the neighborhood and does not get out of date as quickly as national news.

24
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:46,270
If there is no room for it in this week's edition, an item can sometimes be held over until the following week.

25
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,920
Editors must never forget that the success of any newspaper depends on advertising.

26
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,300
They're usually anxious to keep the good will of local businessmen for this reason.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,670
Local newspapers do not often comment on problems of national importance and editors rarely take sides on political questions.

28
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,733
But they can often be of service to the community by expressing public feeling on local issues .

29
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:27,946
A newspaper can sometimes persuade the council to take action to provide better shopping facilities , improve transport in the area or preserve local monuments and places of interest.

30
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,386
These papers often sound rather dull and it seems surprising that they all make a profit.

31
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:49,106
But for many people in small towns and villages, the death of someone known to them or the installation of traffic lights at a busy corner nearby can sometimes be more important than a disaster in a foreign country.
